Hi, I'm Cindy, and this is my CSP blog! 


A little bit about me, I was born in and grew up in San Diego, and we've moved once in my lifetime. I enjoy reading, listening to music, and sleeping, but since school just started, I don't think we've gotten nearly enough of that.  

In terms of CSP experience, I've always heard of coding as a super-cool super-helpful life skill, but never really learned any coding. Now, it seems a lot more versatile than I thought it would be, and certain parts are more complicated than I previously thought. Overall, I still have a lot to learn and a lot to work on.

## Tools Hack
Personally, I like WSL, because we worked really cosely with it. In the beginning, I struggled a lot with installing it, spending a lot of time on google trying to research my issue, but things seemed to calm down after I manually installed it. Now, the first thing I usually type in Powershell is "wsl".

## Installation Hack
I like using the make command, because even though I initially had problems with this command, the issues were easily remedied by changing a few lines of code to comments. Now, I can use it to see what changes I'm making, and track which pieces of code show up where. It's really facinating to see the changes in real time.
